# MBP16-BOOTCAMP-SPEAKERMOD 2.0  
  
## Notice  
This configuration is based on tuning for pure sound output without Dolby Atmos. This means that if you want to try it out, you must disable Dolby Atmos. Additionally, you need to disable Dolby Atmos in the Task Manager's Services tab, as turning it off in the Dolby Atmos Plane is not sufficient. I also recommend removing the Dolby Atmos app, just in case.
